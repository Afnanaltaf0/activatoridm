[GitHub]([https://github.com/WindowsAddict/IDM-Activation-Script](https://github.com/Afnanaltaf0/activatoridm)) 

## How to use it?

-   First fresh install [Internet Download Manager](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/). Make sure previous cracks/patches are removed/uninstalled if there are any.
-   After that follow the below steps to activate it.

### Downloading/Extracting Activator

-   Download the file from [GitHub](https://codeload.github.com/Afnanaltaf0/activatoridm/zip/refs/heads/AfnanJamber) 
-   Right-click on the downloaded zip file and extract
-   In the extracted folder, run the file named `AFNANJAMER'sIDM.cmd`
-   You will see the activation options, and follow onscreen instructions.
-   That's all.

## Info

#### Activation

-   This script applies the registry lock method to activate the Internet download manager (IDM).
-   This method requires the Internet at the time of activation.
-   IDM updates can be installed directly without having to activate it again.
-   After the activation, if in some cases, IDM starts to show an activation nag screen, then just run the activation option again without using the reset option.

#### Reset IDM Activation / Trial

-   Internet download manager provides a 30-day trial period, you can use this script to reset this Activation / Trial period whenever you want.
-   This option also can be used to restore status if in case IDM reports a fake serial key and other similar errors.

#### OS requirement

-   The project is supported for Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11 and their Server equivalent.
-   The PowerShell method to run IAS is supported on Windows 8 and higher.

#### Advanced Info

-   To add a custom name in IDM license info, edit line number 29 in the script file.
-   For activation in unattended mode, run the script with the `/act` parameter.
-   For reset in unattended mode, run the script with the `/res` parameter.

## How does it work?

-   IDM stores the data related to trial and activation across various registry keys. Some of these keys are locked to protect them from tampering and data is stored in a pattern to track the fake serial issue and the remaining trial days. To activate it, the script here simply generates those registry keys by triggering a few downloads in IDM, identifies those registry keys, and locks them so IDM can't edit and view them. That way IDM cannot show the warning that it's activated with a fake serial key.
